# <Project 1: SongSlang>
## Description:
  - Considering the endless applications available, we wanted to create a practical and useful application to everyday consumers
      
  - Music genres are spread throughout the world and is a universal language that can be understood despite what language you speak
      
  - We provide a resource that allows you to search song lyrics and provides definitions to lyrics that may be difficult to understand
      
  - Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, our application is filled with functions and styling while being user friendly and reliable to use throughout many platforms

- The SongSlang app allows users to receive information about their favorite artist including : 
  1. An image of the artist/band
  2. Full lyrics of the song by the artist
  3. the connotation and denotation of any lyric 
  

- During this project everyone in the group learned:
  1. How to use outside resources to our advantage
  2. How to efficiently collaborate using Github 
  3. Debugging issues is a tedious task
  4. Staying organized is very important to eliminate any ambiguity in Github collaboration
